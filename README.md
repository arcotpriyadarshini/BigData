# BigData
Big Data Quality Framework: Preprocessing Data in Weather Monitoring Application.

DESCRIPTION: The quality of Big Data is extremely relevant and important. We are examining processes such as
cleansing to fix as much data as possible. subprocess for Filtering, Integration, and Data Transformation, as well as a
noise filter to remove bad data. Big data consistency is important. We propose that different forms of raw data be
evaluated to increase precision in the pre-handling stage, because some bits of data are not used later in the process.
These large amounts of data might come from a variety of sources, including business network exchange systems,
consumer records, produced by a computer and real-time data sensors from the Internet of Things. All the information
and abilities for their implementation are stored in data in a big data network.
